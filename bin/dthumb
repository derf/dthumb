=head1 NAME

dthumb - Generate Thumbnails + Index for a set of images

=head1 SYNOPSIS

B<dthumb> [I<options>]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

dthumb will create an F<index.xhtml> with a list (thumbnails) of
all images found in the current directory; the thumbnails will link to the
images.

Note that recursion is not yet supported.

=head1 OPTIONS

=over

=item B<-n>, B<--no-names>

Do not show image names below thumbnails

=item B<-d>, B<--size> I<pixels>

Maximum thumbnail size (either width or height).  Defaults to 200

=item B<-s>, B<--spacing> I<float>

Use I<float> as spacing factor.
The size of each image element (image + possible border around it) is the
number of pixels (see --size) times I<float>.
So for B<1.1> you have a small border around each image, for B<1.0> you have
no border at all, etc.

=item B<-q>, B<--quality> I<int>

Set thumbnail quality.
Accepts values between 0 and 100, where 100 is the highest possible quality

=back

=head1 EXIT STATUS

Zero upon success, non-zero otherwise.

=head1 CONFIGURATION

None.

=head1 FILES

B<dthumb> always works in the current working directory.  It will create the
file F<index.xhtml>, in which the HTML code for the thumbnail list is saved.

It also creates two directories: F<.thumbs> for the thumbnail images, and
F<.dthumb>, which contains various data (so far icons and javascript code).

=head1 DEPENDENCIES

=over

=item * autodie (Included in core as of perl 5.10.1)

=item * Data::Section

=item * Image::Imlib2

=back

=head1 BUGS AND LIMITATIONS

Thumbnails of changed images are not yet recreated.
