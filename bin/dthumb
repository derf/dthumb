=head1 NAME

dthumb - Generate Thumbnails + Index for a set of images

=head1 SYNOPSIS

B<dthumb> [I<options>]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

dthumb will create an F<index.xhtml> with a list (thumbnails) of
all images found in the current directory; the thumbnails will link to the
images.

The F<index.xhtml> file will always be created in the current directory, the
thumbnails will be saved in F<.thumbs> below it.

Note that recursion is not yet supported.

=head1 OPTIONS

=over

=item B<-x>, B<--archive>

Create (and link) an "image.tar" archive containing all full-size image files.
All but the last directories in the files' path are stripped, besides that the
directory structure is preserved. So, if you run dthumb -x in
.../mydir/, the archive will contain mydir/1.jpg, mydir/2.jpg etc.

=item B<-n>, B<--no-names>

Do not show image names below thumbnails

=item B<-d>, B<--size> I<pixels>

Maximum thumbnail size (either width or height).  Defaults to 200

=item B<-s>, B<--spacing> I<float>

Use I<float> as spacing factor.
The size of each image element (image + possible border around it) is the
number of pixels (see --size) times I<float>.
So for B<1.1> you have a small border around each image, for B<1.0> you have
no border at all, etc.

=item B<-q>, B<--quality> I<int>

Set thumbnail quality.
Accepts values between 0 and 100, where 100 is the highest possible quality

=back

=head1 EXIT STATUS

Zero upon success, non-zero otherwise.

=head1 CONFIGURATION

None.

=head1 DEPENDENCIES

=over

=item * autodie (Included in core as of perl 5.10.1)

=item * Archive::Tar (subject to change)

=item * Image::Imlib2

=back

=head1 BUGS AND LIMITATIONS

Thumbnails of changed images are not yet recreated.

When used with B<-x>, the completer tar archive is kept in memory, leading to
enormous memory usage and possibly out-of-memory errors.
