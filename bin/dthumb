=head1 NAME

dthumb - Generate Thumbnails + Index for a set of images

=head1 SYNOPSIS

B<dthumb> [I<options>]

=head1 VERSION

This manual documents B<dthumb> version 0.1

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<dthumb> will create an F<index.xhtml> with a list (thumbnails) of
all images found in the current directory; the thumbnails will link to the
images.

Note that recursion is not yet supported.

During operation, B<dthumb> will show its progress on STDERR.

=head1 OPTIONS

=over

=item B<-L>, B<--no-lightbox>

Disable Javascript lightbox.  Note that in the current implementations, this
simple skips installation of the data files.  The lightbox link in the HTML
will still be written, leading to 404s on the server.  This will be fixed.

=item B<-n>, B<--no-names>

Do not show image names below thumbnails

=item B<-d>, B<--size> I<pixels>

Maximum thumbnail size (either width or height).  Defaults to 200

=item B<-s>, B<--spacing> I<float>

Use I<float> as spacing factor.
The size of each image element (image + possible border around it) is the
number of pixels (see --size) times I<float>.
So for B<1.1> you have a small border around each image, for B<1.0> you have
no border at all, etc.

Defaults to 1.1

=item B<-q>, B<--quality> I<int>

Set thumbnail quality.
Accepts values between 0 and 100, where 100 is the highest possible quality.
Default is 75

=back

=head1 EXIT STATUS

Zero upon success, non-zero otherwise.

=head1 CONFIGURATION

None.

=head1 FILES

B<dthumb> always works in the current working directory.  It will create the
file F<index.xhtml>, in which the HTML code for the thumbnail list is saved.

It also creates two directories: F<.thumbs> for the thumbnail images, and
F<.dthumb>, which contains various data (so far icons and javascript code).

=head1 DEPENDENCIES
